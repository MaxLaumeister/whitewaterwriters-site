  <h1>Authors</h1>

We work with previously underdeveloped young talent. Unusually we work with writers in groups, in intensive training camps that are sponsored by a school or other organisation.    

If you are interested in sponsoring a group of authors, please get in touch.  They might be gifted and talented students who aren't being stretched, they might be writers who are having trouble with how education is structured. We've worked with writers from Dunfermline to Nigeria to Amsterdam, from 10 to 21, and from top-tier university to category B prison: we're interested in talent wherever we find it.  Please get in touch.
