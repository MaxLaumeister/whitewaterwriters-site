<p> “Volunteering on the White Water Writers project was an experience I’ll never forget. It was fantastic to see such positive changes in the young writers over such a short period of time. It gave me the opportunity to work with an age group I hadn’t worked with before and that was a challenge but a thoroughly enjoyable one. I felt well supported by the other facilitators I worked with as well as the White Water Writers team. The training workshop and materials were easy to follow and gave me confidence that I could help facilitate the team of young writers from the initial project brief all the way to the final edit of their book. I would definitely volunteer again for White Water Writers and would recommend the experience to anybody who loves writing, creativity or helping young people achieve something amazing!”</p>

<p> We are looking for enthusiastic volunteers interested in novel writing and / or working with young people who can spare some time to help run this fantastic project.</p>

<p> We require volunteers who can spare five full days (Monday to Friday) out of their schedule. </p>

<p> The five days are referred to by us as a ‘camp’. This is non-residential in nature and fits into the normal school day but pupils who are taking part are taken out of their normal routine to focus solely on the writing camp. It is an intense process for all and requires a lot of energy and enthusiasm from our volunteers to keep the young people motivated right through to the end. On days that you are volunteering, you will be expected to be available from 8am – 5pm. A typical day starts at 8:30am and finishes around 3 -4pm.</p>


<p> Once you have signed up to become a volunteer we will organise a suitable time for your training and make sure you have everything you need before you run a camp. In return for your time we will reimburse you for all your travel expenses, this will include petrol costs if you drive or ticket prices if you use public transport.</p>

<p>If you would like to become a volunteer please email us on contact@whitewaterwriters.com</p>
